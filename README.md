# Abstract

Major life events affect our wellbeing. However the comparative impact
of different events, which often co-occur, has not been systematically
evaluated, or studies assumed that the impacts are *equivalent in both
amplitude and duration*, that different wellbeing domains are equally
affected, and that individuals exhibit *hedonic adaptation*. We
evaluated the individual and conditional impact of eighteen major
life-events, and compared their effects on *affective and cognitive
wellbeing* in a large population-based cohort using fixed-effect
regression models assessing within person change. Several commonly cited
events had little, if any, independent effect on wellbeing (promotion,
being fired, friends passing), whilst others had profound impacts
regardless of co-occurring events (e.g., financial loss, death of
partner, childbirth). No life events had overall positive effects on
both types of wellbeing, but separation, injury/illnesses and monetary
losses caused negative impacts on both, which did not display hedonic
adaptation. Affective hedonic adaptation to all positive events occurred
by two years but monetary gains and retirement had ongoing benefits on
cognitive wellbeing. Marriage, retirement and childbirth had positive
effects on cognitive wellbeing but no overall effect on affective
wellbeing, whilst moving home was associated with a negative effect on
cognitive wellbeing but no affective wellbeing response. Describing the
independent impact of different life events, and, for some, the
differential affective and life satisfaction responses, and lack of
hedonic adaptation people display, may help clinicians, economists and
policy-makers, but individual’s hopes for happiness from positive events
appears misplaced.

## Introduction

The observation that major life events, such as marriage, death of a
child or spouse, bankruptcy or lottery winnings have a substantial
impact on our wellbeing is widely appreciated and self-apparent. While
such colloquial observations confirm our universal experience, they do
not tell us anything about either the relative impact of different
events on wellbeing, or the duration of any impact. For instance, is the
death of one’s spouse worse than separation or divorce? Does the
positive benefit of marriage last longer than a major financial
windfall?

A partial answer to these questions has been provided by research on
hedonic adaptation, which suggests that wellbeing ultimately returns to
a set baseline (Gilbert, 2009). Early cross-sectional studies claimed
that people adapt to events, both good and bad, over time (Brickman et
al., 1978). Large scale longitudinal studies that follow individuals
over time indicate that the amount of adaptation varies by event (Clark
et al., 2008; Frijters et al., 2011; Lucas, 2007, 2005). However, such
studies generally assess the impact through checklists that treat
life-events as equal (Dohrenwend, 2006; Gray et al., 2004; Wethington et
al., 1997); or are restricted to the impact of a small set of life
events on a single measure of wellbeing (Luhmann et al., 2012). Clinical
experience tells us that in some cases an individual’s wellbeing does
not return to baseline after a significant life event, or may take many
years, and that responses differ greatly.

Subjective wellbeing is not a unitary entity (Diener et al., 2017), and
different components of wellbeing may respond differently to life
events. The facets of subjective wellbeing are separable by factor
analysis and have distinct associations with other variables (Busseri
and Sadava, 2011; Diener, 1984; Schimmack, 2008). In particular,
cognitive and affective components have been distinguished. The
cognitive component refers to a deliberate, goal-directed evaluation of
life satisfaction (global or domain-specific), while the affective
component refers to the frequency and intensity of positive and negative
emotional responses to events and current moods. As such, it has been
proposed that they differ in their stability over time, as well as in
their reaction to life events. The single meta-analysis in the area
found distinct temporal dynamics of cognitive and affective components
to events such as unemployment, bereavement and childbirth, but only
when comparing across different studies (Luhmann et al., 2012).

An important confounder this meta-analysis found in many longitudinal
studies was the differential ascertainment and handling of other
concurrent life events, which obfuscates any direct comparison between
studies. For instance, losing one’s job may co-occur with moving home,
separation from a loved one or a change in socioeconomic status, any of
which may be the primary driver of changes in wellbeing. Few
longitudinal studies have compared the impact of life events on
wellbeing in the context of a wide range of other events; and none to
our knowledge have compared their impact on different components of
wellbeing over the same time period in the same sample.

We fill this gap by comparing the impact of a broad range of supposedly
positive and negative major life events (18) on cognitive and affective
components of wellbeing in a single large population-representative
cohort spanning sixteen years (2001 to 2016), which allows us to track
changes within individuals over a sizeable time window around each
event’s occurrence.

## Methods

#### Data

The HILDA survey is a longitudinal, nationally representative study of
Australian households. The survey covers a range of dimensions including
social, demographic, health and economic conditions using a combination
of face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers and a
self-completion questionnaire. It began in 2001 with the survey of
13,969 persons in 7,682 households. Each year since interviews have been
conducted with all willing members of each household who are at least 15
years old at the time of the interview. The sample attrition is
comparable to other national longitudinal surveys such as the British
Household Panel Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel Survey
(Watson and Wooden, 2006). We use the 2002-2016 waves of HILDA in our
main analysis.

#### Wellbeing Measures

The cognitive and affective wellbeing measures were obtained from a
single-item question (life-satisfaction) and item 9 from the SF-36 (a
36-item questionnaire) respectively.

*Cognitive wellbeing*. Overall life satisfaction was obtained from the
annual face-to-face interview using the response to the question:

> “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life?”

Respondents were asked to:

> “Pick a number between 0 and 10 to indicate how satisfied you are” and
> that “the more satisfied you are, the higher the number you should
> pick”.

*Affective wellbeing*. Each survey contains the SF-36, a widely used
self-completion measure of health status (Ware Jr, 2000). It comprises
36 items which are used to measure eight scales covering various aspects
of physical, emotional and mental health. We calculated a summed score
based on item 9 (9a-9i), where 5 questions dealt with positive and
negative aspects of mental health (e.g., “Felt so down in the dumps
nothing could cheer me up”, “Been happy”), and four questions dealt with
positive and negative aspects of vitality (e.g., “feel full of life”,
“felt worn out”). We reverse scored relevant items to ensure the
summed score represented better well-being with higher scores. The
Cronbach’s alpha for the 9 questions in item 9 was 0.894 (see
Supplementary Material).

*Life events*. Details on life events are collected in the
self-completion questionnaire of HILDA and have been included since wave
2 (2002). This section is completed after the life satisfaction scores
and SF-36 questions, minimising the potential bias that respondent’s
recollection of the life events may have on their evaluation of the
wellbeing measures. For each event, respondents were asked whether the
event occurred in the last 12 months and how recently it occurred in
three-month intervals (i.e. quarters).

The life events are shown in Table 1 below:

*Table 1. List of 22 life events and their
description*

| Moved           | changed residence                                         |
| Hired           | changed jobs (i.e. employer)                              |
| Promoted        | promoted at work                                          |
| Retired         | retired from workforce                                    |
| Money gained    | major gain in finances (e.g., lottery win, inheritance)   |
| Pregnant        | you (or your partner) got pregnant                        |
| Married         | got married                                               |
| Childbirth      | birth (or adoption) of a child                            |

*Note*: *Widowed* includes deaths of children but with only 1407 deaths
under 15 in the entire population in 2016 we expect few such deaths so
we use the label for simplicity.

#### Model Design

Using the quarterly and annual indicators for an event, we modelled the
effect of life events on the current wellbeing score as a function of
time since the life event. To estimate these *within-subject* effects,
we estimated a series of linear fixed effects regression models.

Under this approach we have a linear model with \(N\) individuals and
\(T\) time-points:

<p align="center">

y<sub>*it*</sub> = βX<sub>*it*</sub> + α<sub>*i*</sub> +
ε<sub>*it*</sub>    for *t* = 1…*T* and *i* = 1…*N*    (1)

</p>

X<sub>*it*</sub> is a matrix of control variables, that is, a set of
dummy variables representing lags and leads on the life event. For
example, *pre36* = 1 if wellbeing (the outcome) was measured 2-3 years
before the life event; *pre24* = 1 if wellbeing was measured 1-2 years
before the event;… *post24* = 1 if wellbeing was measured 2-3 years
after the event; and *post36* = 1 if wellbeing was measured 3-4 years
after the event. In total, we had seven dummy variables indicating the
outcome variable y<sub>*it*</sub> was obtained after the life event
(*post00*, *post03*, *post06*, *post09*, *post12*, *post24*, *post36*),
as well as three dummy variables indicating \(y_{it}\) was obtained
before the event (*pre12*, *pre24*, *pre36*). Note that *pre36* acted as
the reference timepoint against which the effects of all other
time-points were expressed.

We estimated conditional models to determine the independent effect of
each life event in the context of other events which may be present for
an individual. Our conditional models included all other events as
potential channels in X<sub>*it*</sub>, as well as socioeconomic status
(termed the “SEIFA index” and derived from the postcode of the
participant), education (coded in a standard Australian Bureau of
Statistics method) and age; features which may change with time along
with the changes in wellbeing outcome (Table S3). Each conditional model
also included a set of year dummies in X<sub>*it*</sub>. We estimated
(1) by OLS after taking a *within-subject* transformation of each
variable (such that β was identified by deviations in X<sub>*it*</sub>
over time). This allows us to remove any time invariant heterogeneity
contained in α<sub>*i*</sub> (for example, if innately unhappy people
are more likely to divorce, and other potential selection effects).

We assumed that an individual can be affected simultaneously by more
than one occurrence of the same life event, which essentially allows for
an additive effect of multiple events on wellbeing. This is not of
particular concern for events that occur infrequently (e.g. death of
spouse or child) but may matter for more frequent events (e.g. moving
home). We also estimated models that assumed only the most proximate
event affected current wellbeing (similar to Frijters et al., 2011) as a
sensitivity check, and obtained similar results to those reported below.

Finally, when an event occurred in the last 12 months but the respondent
did not specify the quarter the event occurred (between 4.5%-31.7% of
cases depending on the event), we treated that year as a missing
observation (we do however use the fact that we know an event occurred
in that year to construct pre- and post-indicators for other years). In
a follow-up sensitivity analysis presented in the Supplementary Material
(*Uncontaminated Models*) we restricted our sample to only those
observed consistently for a seven-year window around the life event.

The analysis was performed in *R* (version 3.5.1) (R Core Team, 2013),
using the tidyverse package (version 1.2.1) (Wickham, 2017), and the plm
package (1.6-6) for fixed effects estimates (Croissant and Millo, 2008).

#### Comparing the total impact of life events

In order to compare the total impact of life events, taking into account
both magnitude and duration of effect, we calculated the
area-under-the-curve (AUC) for each event in each model (as well as
variance). The AUC was calculated by:

<p align="center">

*AUC*<sub>*event*</sub> = ∑X<sub>β</sub>δ<sub>*t*</sub>    (2)

</p>

Where X<sub>β</sub> is a *T* length vector of beta coefficients for each
time-point, and δ<sub>*t*</sub> is the vector of time (months) between
each time-point. The AUC is therefore the summation of all of the
marginal effects on the pre- and post-event dummies (both positive and
negative) between -24 months and 48 months of the event occurring,
weighted by the number of months the marginal effect represents. This
serves as a useful summary of the overall effect of the event on
wellbeing and facilitates comparison between events with different time
paths.

The variance for each *AUC* was estimated by:

<p align="center">

σ<sub>*AUC*</sub> = δ<sub>*t*</sub>’**Σ**<sub>*t*</sub>δ<sub>*t*</sub>
   (3)

</p>

Where **Σ** is the variance-covariance matrix from each model.

## Results

#### Subjective wellbeing

The mean levels of affective wellbeing (mental component score) and
cognitive wellbeing (life satisfaction score) in the HILDA dataset were
39 and 8 respectively. The mean level of wellbeing over years (2001 to
2016) suggested that trends in affective wellbeing were not matched by
trends in cognitive wellbeing, in particular a recent decline in the
former with no change in the latter, as shown in Figure S2
(Supplementary materials). The correlation between cognitive and
affective wellbeing measures was *r<sup>2</sup>* = 0.23, indicating they
share less than a quarter of variance.

#### Life events

The most widely experienced event (i.e., highest proportion of sample
experiencing it at least once) was *Moved*, while the least widely
experienced event was *Jailed* (Figure S3 Supplementary Material). The
four most frequent events, with a similar frequency, were *Family
harmed* (serious injury or illness of a close family member), *Hired*,
*Pregnant* and *Moved*, which occurred about once every 4.5 years on
average (Figure S4 Supplementary Material). The least frequent events
were *Widowed* and *Married*, which occurred once every nine years or
less. Figure S4 (Supplementary Material) shows the frequency of most
events was once every six years or less, indicating the occurrence of
multiple events in our time window was relatively infrequent. We
excluded home destroyed by natural disaster (*Home lost*), *Relative
died* and *Jailed* events in the plots presented below as they were
experienced by a relatively small number of individuals or were not
measured for the entire 15 years. However, they were still included as
covariates in the modeling below.

#### Effect of life events on subjective wellbeing

*Unconditional effect of life events*. Figures 1 & 2 below show the
effect of each life event on cognitive and affective wellbeing, ignoring
any concurrent life events (or any other covariates apart from year).

We a priori defined 9 positively and 9 negatively valenced events and
present them in separate figures to facilitate comparison between events
of the same valence (although this was not born out for reconciliation
which had an anticipatory negative effect and no positive effect).
*Married*, *Childbirth* and a major financial gain (*Money gained*)
produce the largest positive impact on wellbeing, while *Widowed*,
*Separated* and major financial loss (*Money lost*) produced the largest
negative impact on wellbeing.

![](figures/unconditional_good_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**Figure 1 legend.** *Impact of positively-valenced (“good”) events on
affective and cognitive wellbeing. For each life event (panel),
coefficients are plotted with the time of the event relative to
measurement on the x-axis, and the amount of change in wellbeing (in
standard deviation units) produced by the event on the y-axis.
Differences from zero represent the marginal effect of the life event on
wellbeing. The panels in each figure are ordered by the magnitude change
in wellbeing (from large to small). Confidence intervals were calculated
using cluster-robust standard errors (on individuals).*

![](figures/unconditional_bad_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**Figure 2 legend.** *Impact of negatively-valenced (“bad”) events on
affective and cognitive wellbeing. Coefficients are plotted across
months between event and measurement on the x-axis, and the marginal
effect on wellbeing (in standard deviation units) on the y-axis.
Confidence intervals were calculated using cluster-robust standard
errors (on individuals).*

Sometimes the effect of a life event seems to precede the time of the
event (-24 or -12 on the x-axis). These anticipatory effects suggest the
life events are not completely unexpected or surprising, and in some
cases (e.g., moving) the effect seemed entirely anticipatory with no
post-event impact.

*Conditional effect of life events*. Figures 3 & 4 show the results of a
model which includes all other life events as covariates, as well as
year, age, changes in education, and changes in a socioeconomic proxy
(i.e., SEIFA index). This model thus estimates effect of each event on
wellbeing independent of other events, time-varying observable
characteristics, and all time-invariant characteristics (observed and
unobservable).

![](figures/conditional_good_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**Figure 3 legend.** *Conditional effect of positively-valenced (“good”)
events on affective and cognitive wellbeing, after accounting for all 21
other events as well as changes in education, age, and SEIFA.
Coefficients are plotted across time on the x-axis, with the marginal
effect on the y-axis. Confidence intervals were calculated using
cluster-robust standard errors (on individuals)*.

![](figures/conditional_bad_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

**Figure 4 legend.** *Conditional effect of negatively-valenced (“bad”)
events on affective and cognitive wellbeing, after accounting for all 21
other events as well as changes in education, age, and SEIFA.
Coefficients are plotted across time on the x-axis, with the marginal
effect on the y-axis. Confidence intervals were calculated using
cluster-robust standard errors (on individuals)*.

The conditional effect of most life events on wellbeing revealed a
similar relative magnitude among events as the unconditional effect;
*Widowed*, *Separated* and *Money lost* are worst, while *Married*,
*Childbirth* and *Money gained* are best. Furthermore the differential
effect of positive events on cognitive over affective wellbeing is still
generally present. However, conditioning on other events did change the
impact of some individual events. For instance, the conditional effect
of reconciliation with partner (*Reconciled*) on cognitive wellbeing is
more positive than the unconditional
effect.

#### Total impact of life events and the comparative effect on Cognitive and Affective Wellbeing

The combined magnitude and duration of life events, summarised by the
area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the wellbeing response to each event is
shown in Figure 5. Comparing the AUC from each unconditional model with
each conditional model indicates the strength of the confounding by
other events and time varying covariates. Each vertical crossbar
represents the AUC and the interval around the crossbar represents 95
percent confidence intervals. As expected, the conditional effects are
generally closer to zero (i.e. smaller) than the unconditional effects.
However, there are exceptions such as *Widowed*, where the large
negative impact is not affected by adjusting for other life events, and
the three events with the most negative impact remain significant. The
differential impact of positive events on cognitive wellbeing and
affective wellbeing is shown in Figure 5 (and Supplementary Table S6).
Marriage, retirement and childbirth had positive effects on cognitive
wellbeing but no overall effect on affective wellbeing, separation had a
greater negative effect on cognitive than affective wellbeing, whilst
moving home was associated with a negative effect on cognitive wellbeing
but no affective wellbeing response.

\*\**p* \< .01, \*\*\**p* \< .001).

## Discussion

The present study confirms what people know; that not all life events
are equal and many are concurrent with other events. In some respect,
this may seem to be a self-apparent conclusion to anyone who has ever
lived but epidemiological research often ignores this by using summed
checklists to assess impact, or just evaluates the impact of one event
(Dohrenwend, 2006; Gray et al., 2004; Wethington et al., 1997). Our
results also quantify the difference and allow us to infer the average
effect in the population. Other studies have noted differences between
events in the magnitude or duration of effect on wellbeing (Frijters et
al., 2011; Luhmann et al., 2012), however we focus on the total impact
(both magnitude and duration). Previous longitudinal studies following
individuals across time also indicate health shocks (the duration of
disability) (Lucas, 2007), and separation (divorce) (Lucas, 2005; Lucas
et al., 2003) have long-term negative effects but unlike Lucas (2005),
we found that the impact of the death of a spouse seemed to diminish by
2 years. The evidence for long-term effects of marriage and unemployment
is mixed, with some studies showing that they continue to influence
wellbeing long after they have occurred (Lucas et al., 2004), while
others report adaption to these same events (Clark et al., 2008;
Frijters et al., 2011) as we found. Figure 5 provides a comparison of
the total impact (magnitude and duration) of each event on wellbeing.
For instance, on average the impact of a major financial loss on both
types of wellbeing was the greatest whilst health shocks, losing a loved
one (widowed), separation or divorce tended not to have as much negative
impact on both. Conversely, getting married, a major financial gain,
retirement and childbirth had positive effects on cognitive wellbeing
with little overall positive effect on affective wellbeing. These data
demonstrate that the practice of treating life events as comparable is
untenable.

*The impact of some events is negligible after accounting for the impact
of concurrent events.* In general, the conditional effects of life
events were a little closer to zero than the unconditional effects, but
in almost all cases this was minimal, reflecting how uncommon
co-occurrence actually was. However the unconditional positive effect of
pregnancy on cognitive wellbeing was all but reversed once concurrent
events (childbirth) were accounted for.

These results also challenge the notion of many of the identified life
events as being intrinsically “stressful”, the implication of which is
that they should have some negative effect on wellbeing. Holmes and
Rahe’s Social Readjustment Scale (Holmes and Rahe, 1967) weights
marriage as the sixth most stressful event yet we found no negative
impact on affective wellbeing and a profound anticipatory and subsequent
positive effect on life satisfaction. Conversely people’s wellbeing in
the lead up to some positive events was impaired, the most notable being
reconciliation which most likely demonstrates the effect of relationship
difficulties just prior to the event.

*The differential impact of events on the components of affective and
cognitive wellbeing supports their distinction as separate constructs,
although both show hedonic adaptation.* A novel aspect of the present
study is the comparative differences of the affective and cognitive
wellbeing response to certain events. For instance, some positive events
had a substantial impact on cognitive wellbeing while eliciting
relatively little impact on affective wellbeing or “happiness” (e.g.,
*Married, Retired, Childbirth, Pregnant*). In contrast, negative events
tended to have comparable and untoward effects on both cognitive and
affective wellbeing, with the exception of *Separated* which again
elicited a greater (negative) impact on cognitive wellbeing, and
*Moving* which had no affective response but reduced life satisfaction.
The differential impact of events on the components of affective and
cognitive wellbeing supports the distinction between wellbeing
components and their treatment as separate constructs. It also implies
that, on average, hoping for happiness from positive events appears
misplaced.

#### Limitations

A few general issues are worth discussing in large, longitudinal models
and studies of this kind. Such studies preclude the use of the
experience sampling method of assessing affective wellbeing which many
consider the best method for assessing short term intra-individual
variation in affective wellbeing. The fixed effects models exclude
anyone who did not experience the event in the time window of interest.
This means that in any particular event, such as marriage, average
differences in subjective wellbeing between married people and unmarried
people may be present, however these *between-group* differences will
not be revealed by the fixed effects model which estimates
*within-subject* changes in the sample of interest. As a result, these
population estimates can reveal what to expect once an event has
occurred, but cannot be used to predict whether an event such as
marriage will increase or decrease wellbeing in any particular case.
That is, the effects of marriage may be specific to the kinds of people
who get married and should not be offered as evidence or a reason to get
married.

We used an unbalanced panel, which means a slightly different set of
individuals may contribute to the pre- and post-event coefficients
(although there is considerable overlap). A balanced approach (Clark et
al., 2008) only includes people with measurements before and after the
event, which ensures the same cohort is followed over time. However,
balancing reduces efficiency and risks inducing potential selection
effects, so other researchers have taken a more liberal approach and
included anyone with more than one consecutive observation, regardless
of when those observations occurred (Frijters et al., 2011), which we
follow in this study. In a sensitivity analysis we restricted the sample
to a balanced panel observed pre- and post- event (see *Balanced Models*
in Supplementary Materials) which did not materially change the overall
results or inferences.

We also note some causes of potentially non-random measurement error
inherent in any dynamic model of this sort. First, due to censoring
issues we do not know at time *t = 1* if a life event occurred before
that first year (e.g., 2002). Similarly, at time *t = T* we do not know
whether an event occurred after the final year (e.g., 2016). We do not
expect this to significantly bias our estimates since many events occur
infrequently and this only affects years close to the endpoints of our
data. A similar issue arises in the case of missing life event
information‚ either because the respondent did not complete that part of
the questionnaire or because they are missing from the sample in a
particular year. In both cases, we assumed no life event occurred in the
missing year when constructing pre- and post- indicators. Again, we
expect any bias to be small given that most life events are infrequent
and more than 65 percent of people are responding year-to-year (see
Table S2 in Supplementary Material). In a follow-up analysis
(*Uncontaminated Models* in Supplementary Materials), we excluded from
the sample any observations within three years of missing life event
data to estimate an uncontaminated (as well as balanced) model. This
means we only estimated effects for the years 2005-2012, and so after
balancing and de-contamination this was our most restricted sample. As a
result, our estimates became less precise and, while generally
qualitatively similar to the main results, some effects became
statistically insignificant (particularly for the positive events).

#### Summary

These results present for the first time the comparative anticipatory,
short- and medium- term effects of a wide range of life events on
people’s happiness (affective wellbeing) and life satisfaction
(cognitive wellbeing). Policy makers now focus on measuring wellbeing as
an indicator of success through such metrics as the OECD’s “Better Life
Index”, Gallup’s “Global Wellbeing Index” and the European Social
Survey. The Global Wellness Economy Monitor suggests this is now a $4.2
trillion dollar industry. Identifying whether there are life events, the
prevalence of which can be enhanced or reduced through health, family or
justice policies, that will affect these outcomes is likely to become
more important in the future.
